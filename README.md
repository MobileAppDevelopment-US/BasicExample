# BasicExample 
I decided to make this project and put in it an example of architecture, a set of base classes and extensions, an example of working with a network, using different libraries, notifications, a spinner, loading a placeholder and photos, transitions between screens, the screen of the first and other inputs to the application, and many others code examples and solutions.

I want to process many different cases and this code will help me create new applications even faster.
